# Hi, I'm Clayson Varela 👋
###  High School Class of 2026

I’m a student developer interested in using mathematics, data, and programming to understand and model real-world systems — from financial markets to physical and mechanical processes.
I enjoy building projects that turn raw data into insights, test ideas through simulation, and explore how analytical tools can support better decision-making in science, engineering, and business contexts.
