# Hi, I'm Clayson Varela 👋
###  High School Class of 2026

* I’m a student developer interested in using mathematics, data, and programming to understand and model real-world systems — from financial markets to physical and mechanical processes.

* I enjoy building projects that turn raw data into insights, test ideas through simulation, and explore how analytical tools can support better decision-making in science, engineering, and business contexts.

##  Capstone Projects (The Big Stuff)
*Major research projects and full-stack applications.*

###  [Global Air Defense Simulator (GADS)](https://github.com/ClaysonV/Air_Defense_Simulator)
**Focus:** Computational Physics, Sensor Fusion & Autonomous Guidance
**Tech:** Python, NumPy (Vector Calculus), Matplotlib (Real-time 3D Animation)
> A real-time physics engine simulating aerial intercepts. It implements Linear Kalman Filtering to track targets through simulated stealth noise and uses Proportional Navigation algorithms for missile guidance. Features a live tactical dashboard visualizing atmospheric drag, 3D trajectories, and kill probability analytics.


###  [The Portfolio Optimizer & Factor Engine](https://github.com/ClaysonV/Portfolio_Optimizer)
**Focus:** Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) & Risk Factor Analysis
**Tech:** Python, SciPy (minimize), Statsmodels (OLS), Monte Carlo, Seaborn
> A wealth simulation engine that builds mathematically optimal portfolios. It runs 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations to visualize the Efficient Frontier and uses SciPy to solve for the specific asset allocation that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio.


###  [SMA Project](https://github.com/ClaysonV/SMA_Project)
**Focus:** Computational Finance
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance, Matplotlib
> A backtesting engine for a trend-following strategy (50/200-day SMA Crossover)
