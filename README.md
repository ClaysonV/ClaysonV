# Hi, I'm Clayson Varela 👋
###  High School Class of 2026

* I’m a student developer interested in using mathematics, data, and programming to understand and model real-world systems — from financial markets to physical and mechanical processes.

* I enjoy building projects that turn raw data into insights, test ideas through simulation, and explore how analytical tools can support better decision-making in science, engineering, and business contexts.

##  Capstone Projects (The Big Stuff)
*Major research projects and full-stack applications.*
###  [The Portfolio Optimizer & Factor Engine](https://github.com/ClaysonV/Portfolio_Optimizer)
**Focus:** Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) & Risk Factor Analysis
**Tech:** Python, SciPy (minimize), Statsmodels (OLS), Monte Carlo, Seaborn
> A wealth simulation engine that builds mathematically optimal portfolios. It runs 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations to visualize the Efficient Frontier and uses SciPy to solve for the specific asset allocation that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio.


###  [SMA_Project](https://github.com/ClaysonV/SMA_Project)
**Focus:** Computational Finance
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance, Matplotlib
> A backtesting engine for a trend-following strategy (50/200-day SMA Crossover)

##  The Lab (Experiments & Homework)
*Small scripts, problem solvers, and logic puzzles.*
